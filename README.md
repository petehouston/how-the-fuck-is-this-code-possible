# Coding is really tough! Believe me...

Tweak your brains with these crazy questions. 

We have some customers, they're pro, don't know about coding, only know how to Google to evaluate our code.

We need to handle some eh-oh requirements from our clients. No chance to avoid!

If you're willing to stay on the job, then read the `challenges`.

Then, PR your solutions in `solutions/` directory.

**NOTE**: challenges are vary, depending on some programming languages, so pick the challenges with appropriate programming languages of your choice.
